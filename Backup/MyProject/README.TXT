:::::::::::::!Thanks for downloading this template!:::::::::::::

This template was created solely by extermin8tor. This template was created in my spare time and I have decided to make it free. SO NO SELLING BY PEOPLE OTHER THAN ME! If I ever see anybody trying to sell this template I will take legal action against them. You do not have to write anywhere on the page that I created this template unless you want to but I would like this. I also do not care what you use this template for, In other words if you tell somebody you created the template I don't care. Included with the template is the font 04b_21, the Photoshop  file for editing and the read me file. The recommended editing programs are frontpage, photoshop and dreamweaver.

:::::::::::::EDITING THE PHOTOSHOP FILE!:::::::::::::
To edit the photoshop PSD file you must have Photoshop 7.0+ installed on your computer.
To edit the text you must first install the font(s) included with this template by copying 
them to your fonts folder in C:\WINDOWS\FONTS. The fonts are in the \fonts folder (duh!) of this
template. To edit the text in the PSD file just click the text edit button in photoshop and then
the text. After making all the changes neccesary you must click 'save for the web.' in the file
menu and then choose your format (bmp,jpg,gif or png) gif is probably the best. Then you must choose
the folder where you would like to save the sliced files. This will create a image.html file
and a images folder (call the file image or else you will have to recode the template). Then you can move them around (if you move the images elsewhere you have to
also change the HTML code!). Then You are done. Enter all the stuff like text and images for your site and
upload it to your host.
after editing everything please copy back my images called image_11.gif and image_13.gif, these are just black bars that photshop doesnt export.


GUESS WHAT, this template uses an amazing feature called layers. there are layers in the html. i used them so that the dide boxes dont stretch with the main one.
HAVE FUN!!!!

The template also uses a CSS style for the text. it makes it look great and is compatible with most browsers, have fun!

:::::::::::::UPLOADING TO YOUR HOST!:::::::::::::
If you already have a server to host your site on dont read this.
You may choose to get a paid or free host. Free like always is
probably easier to use and best of all FREE! DUH!. A good host 
would be www.95mb.com, www.topcities.com, www.geocities.com, 
www.fortunecity.com. For a bigger listing of free hosts go to
www.thefreesite.com and look.

:::::::::::::FAQ (FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS):::::::::::::
Q:Can you edit the template for me?
A:No I am too busy to do this for free, i have other stuff too do, i will only edit it for a very small fee of five dollars.

Q:Can I email you to ask about the template?
A:Yes of course!

Q:Can I say I made the template!
A:Yes as long as you dont distribute it as yours on the internet.
